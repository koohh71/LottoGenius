# Project Context: New Workspace

## Overview
This directory appears to be a new or empty workspace. No specific project structure or code files were detected during the initial analysis.

## Intended Use
This file (`GEMINI.md`) is intended to store context, conventions, and operational instructions for the Gemini CLI agent. As the project evolves, this file should be updated to reflect:
- **Project Type:** (e.g., Node.js, Python, Rust, Documentation)
- **Key Commands:** Build, run, and test commands.
- **Conventions:** Coding style, architecture patterns, etc.

## Current Status
- **Files:** Minimal (only `GEMINI.md` present).
- **Detected Frameworks:** None.

## Custom Tools
These are custom scripts available in the project for specific tasks.

- **Exchange Rate Checker**:
  - Description: Fetches current exchange rate based on USD. Default target is KRW.
  - Command: `python get_exchange_rate.py <TARGET_CURRENCY_CODE>` (e.g., KRW, JPY, EUR)
  - Output format: "현재 환율: 1 USD = <rate> <currency>"

## Todo
- [ ] Initialize project (e.g., `npm init`, `cargo new`, etc.)
- [ ] Update this file with project specifics.
